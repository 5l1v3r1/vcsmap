You need a recent version of Ruby with [bundler](http://bundler.io) and you might need build tools like `gcc` to build the dependencies.\r\n``` ruby\r\n$ bundle\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nvcsmap already includes a couple of plugins. Each plugin looks for files that match a certain search query, and extracts the right data from those files. To view all plugins run:\r\n```\r\n$ ruby vcsmap.rb list\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo use a plugin, look up the name of the plugin (`[plugin_name]`) and run the following command:\r\n```\r\n$ ruby vcsmap.rb run {plugin_name} {pages} {--no-ascii}\r\n```\r\n- You need to specify the amount of pages you want to search. Each (GitHub) page has 10 possible results.\r\n- Use the `--no-ascii` flag (last) to disable rendering the results as an ASCII table in the command line.\r\n\r\n## Plugin development\r\nTo add a new plugin, create an entry for it in `lib/plugin_list.rb` and create a new plugin class that extends `Vcsmap::Plugin::BasePlugin` in `lib/plugins`. \r\n\r\nEach plugin has a `@search_string` that is used to search for matching files, and a couple of regex matchers to extract the needed data. Of course you don't need to use regex, it's also possible to parse the file (e.g. with `JSON`), as long as your plugin returns a valid `table_header` and matching `credentials`.\r\n\r\n**The easiest way** to develop a new plugin is to copy an simple existing one (like `lib/plugins/solr_dataconfig.rb`) and modify it until it fits your requirements.\r\n\r\n## DISCLAIMER\r\nUsing the data obtained by this tool to gain unauthorized to access computer systems or services is **ILLEGAL** and therefore punisable by law. The author of this tool is **not** responsible for any damage caused by use/abuse of this tool.\r\n",
